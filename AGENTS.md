# Linux Taskbar Window Count Instructions

This repository owns the `workspace-window-count@local` GNOME Shell extension
and its installer integration.
Keep window-count badge implementation in this repo rather than in
linux_configuration_setup.

## Clean Installation Compatibility

All changes must remain compatible with a clean installation run through
`installation_scripts/install.sh`. Do not rely on packages, files, settings, or
manual steps that exist only on the current machine. Add every required
dependency, asset, configuration step, and migration to this repo's installer so
a fresh checkout can reproduce the complete setup.

Keep installation steps idempotent and verify the clean-install path for every
change with tests or structural validation before committing.


## Mandatory programming guidelines prompt

Every agent task in this repository must load the shared
`general-programming-guidelines` skill before the first file edit, using the
harness-native invocation for the runtime in use:

- Codex-family (`ca`, `qa`, `oa`, `na`, …): `$general-programming-guidelines`
- Claude Code, Cline, Grok: `/general-programming-guidelines`
- OpenCode: load `general-programming-guidelines` with the skill tool

Agent Command Center prepends this bare invocation to every dispatched prompt, so the
harness activates the skill before reading the task. When you start a task by hand, invoke it
yourself first. Then follow its Work Loop — dedicated worktree branch before
the first edit, tests, logging, documentation — and do not report the task done
until its Definition of Done checklist passes.
Always finish the delivery: commit in the worktree, merge into the default
branch with `git merge --no-ff`, then reload whatever consumes the change
(installer, skill deployment, service, session). You do not need to be asked.
Never push to a remote and never rewrite history unless the user explicitly
requests it.
